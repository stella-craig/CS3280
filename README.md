# CS3280: Comp Org &amp; Assembly Lang

This course is an introduction to the organization and programming of microcomputers. Topics covered include: organization of microcomputers, 
computer operation, microprocessor programming, Intel IA-32 history, interfacing, memory systems, and virtual memory.

In this course we code in assembly for the Motorola 68HC11 8-bit microcontroller.

We use the software Wookie 2.1. This is a 68HC11 IDE that uses the Motorola as11 assembler and the Wookie 68HC11 emulator.

This course was taken during the Spring semester 2023 at the University of Missouri - Columbia.
